# BlissApplicationTest

**This is a recruitment exercise project for Bliss**


This is the first version I've released so far with still some adjustments that could be improved. With that said, here is the TODO list that would be great to include in this project later on:

- Improve the layout to something more appealing
- Add some cool animations to transations and selections

---

## Actual Project

This is a small Questions Lister that uses a mocked API to list some questions and then vote your answer and share to any email

## How to run this?

- 1 - Download the repo
- 2 - Go to the "BlissApplicationTest" folder which contains the Podfile with the terminal
- 3 - type: pod install
- 4 - Then on Finder, open "BlissApplicationsTest.xcworkspace"

if by any chance you dont have cocoapods installed and #3 gives out an error. Run this command:

gem install cocoapods

Then you can try step #3 again

In order for the Deep link to work. you need to go to Capabilities options in the projects xcode configurations and activate Associated Domains and add the following line:
applinks:blissrecruitment
